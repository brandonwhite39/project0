Harvard CS50 Web 2020 Course Project0

Welcome to my Project!

This is a website created about myself including a home title page and navigation to other windows.
You are able to view "About me", "My Experience", "My Hobbies" and "My Goals" pages.
There is a back button at the bottom of each webpage to return back to the home title page.

The main page has a @media query, the title page changes once the screen size has reached a certain px width.
All of the requirements from the instructions have been met.

index.html - home page
aboutMe.html - about me web page
goals.html - goals web page
hobbies.html - hobbies web page
myExperience.html - my experience webpage
style.scss - contains all scss code for all pages

Hope you enjoy and thanks for looking!
